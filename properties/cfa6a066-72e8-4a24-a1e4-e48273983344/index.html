favorite things about Kansas City are its old glorious buildings - which is why I fell in love with this 1900 Victorian charmer.  This home has seen a lot in it&#39;s 100+ years, including being converted into 4 separate apartments.  Your Cozy Midcentury 2 bedroom is on the 3rd floor.  Once you enter the space, you get to smile and settle in - you&#39;re in your home away from home.  Welcome &amp; relax.

I&#39;ve scoured every antique store in the state to create an authentic mid-century space - focused on peace &amp; comfort.  Enjoy high end bedding &amp; towels.  You&#39;ll find a fully equipped kitchen to meet your cooking &amp; entertaining needs.  Coffee (&amp; sugar &amp; creamer) is provided, or take a short walk to Starbucks just 2 blocks away, or our local favorite - the Roasterie.  Cable is provided, including access to 100&#39;s of channels &amp; movies (just leave cash if you download a movie to rent).  There are also DVDs &amp; board games under the tv for your entertainment.  G. Fiber Internet available - the fastest in town. 

If you&#39;re here for work - there&#39;s a desk in the second bedroom for your use - right under the skylight so you can brainstorm with the clouds :)

For ideas on restaurants, night life &amp; KC attractions while you&#39;re in town, check out my GUIDEBOOK online - a printed copy is also available in the home.</p><div data-v-8823d896><h3 data-v-8823d896> About the Neighborhood</h3><p data-v-8823d896>Southmoreland is such a great neighborhood.  So close to so many things - the Art Institute, the Plaza, Westport, Downtown, a Starbucks 2 blocks away, the Nelson Atkins Museum.  It&#39;s even worth walking the neighborhood to see all the beautiful old homes!
Westport also has some shops, restaurants &amp; antique stores.</p></div><h3 data-v-8823d896> Guest Access </h3><p data-v-8823d896>You access this space through the side door.  When facing the home, follow the sidewalk around to the left.  You will see the red door on the North side of the building.  Unit 3 is located at the TOP of the stairwell.</p><h3 data-v-8823d896> Other Details </h3><p data-v-8823d896>There is plenty of off-street parking in the side lot - able to accommodate a moving van and more than one car if you have it. 

ACCESS:
This is a 3rd floor apartment, accessed through the old &amp; narrow butlers stairwell.  

PETS:
Cats &amp; Dogs that don&#39;t bark are welcome. We must be respectful of the neighbors so cannot have barkers. There is a one-time pet fee of $50.  You must clear your pets with me beforehand.

PARTIES/GATHERINGS/GUESTS:
Kansas City takes gatherings VERY SERIOUSLY.  All guests must be pre-approved by host.  All guests must leave before 10pm.

GUEST VERIFICATION:
You may be asked for additional verification</p><div class="booking-wrapper" data-v-8823d896 data-v-b1aaaca9><div class="booking-component" data-v-b1aaaca9><!----><div class="calendar-col" data-v-b1aaaca9><div class="calendarWrapper" data-v-b1aaaca9 data-v-4ada6278><div class="calendarContainer" data-v-4ada6278><div class="dp__main dp__theme_light dp__flex_display" data-datepicker-instance data-dp-mobile="true" data-v-4ada6278><div><!----><!----></div><div><!----></div></div></div><button class="clear-dates-btn" data-v-4ada6278>Clear Dates</button></div></div><div class="booking-info" data-v-b1aaaca9><h1 data-v-b1aaaca9>Your Stay</h1><div class="placeholder-guest-selector" data-v-b1aaaca9><!--[--><div class="selector-row" data-v-e42f4054><div class="info" data-v-e42f4054><h4 data-v-e42f4054>Adults</h4><p data-v-e42f4054>Ages 13 or above</p></div><div class="counter" data-v-e42f4054><button data-v-e42f4054>-</button><span data-v-e42f4054>2</span><button data-v-e42f4054>+</button></div></div><div class="selector-row" data-v-e42f4054><div class="info" data-v-e42f4054><h4 data-v-e42f4054>Children</h4><p data-v-e42f4054>Ages 2–12</p></div><div class="counter" data-v-e42f4054><button data-v-e42f4054>-</button><span data-v-e42f4054>0</span><button data-v-e42f4054>+</button></div></div><div class="selector-row" data-v-e42f4054><div class="info" data-v-e42f4054><h4 data-v-e42f4054>Infants</h4><p data-v-e42f4054>Under 2</p></div><div class="counter" data-v-e42f4054><button data-v-e42f4054>-</button><span data-v-e42f4054>0</span><button data-v-e42f4054>+</button></div></div><div class="selector-row" data-v-e42f4054><div class="info" data-v-e42f4054><h4 data-v-e42f4054>Pets</h4><p data-v-e42f4054>Not including service animals</p></div><div class="counter" data-v-e42f4054><button data-v-e42f4054>-</button><span data-v-e42f4054>0</span><button data-v-e42f4054>+</button></div></div><!--]--></div><!----><!----></div></div></div><h1 style="text-align:center;" data-v-8823d896>Reviews</h1><div data-v-8823d896 data-v-ed531a9e><div class="loading-text" data-v-ed531a9e> Loading reviews... </div></div><div class="location-wrapper" data-v-8823d896 data-v-d14de1c9><h1 style="text-align:center;" data-v-d14de1c9> &quot;Find Us&quot; Placeholder </h1></div></div></div><footer class="footer" data-v-7bd5f1fc data-v-b501e99c><div class="container" data-v-b501e99c><p data-v-b501e99c>© 2025 Fountain City Stays.

Please include your pet on your reservation.",{},{"cfa6a066-72e8-4a24-a1e4-e48273983344":261},[262,263,264,265,266,267,268,269,270,271,272,273,274,275,276,277,278,279,280,281,282,283,284,285,286,287,288,289,290,291,292,293,294,295],"https://assets.hospitable.com/property_images/904266/hWL6ay8EjksRrgkFGsyNwav7zxwwVdT71ALw7qDw.jpg","https://assets.hospitable.com/property_images/904266/Rq2AHZ8iiVA2AxBykIYxzNY8W3xqKnGWDemoxTOr.jpg","https://assets.hospitable.com/property_images/904266/iNbuoCD9AIZuinuUESIVJ2NEoLeLIUnFfL9vwbZO.jpg","https://assets.hospitable.com/property_images/904266/x8spcFq8Ly7RI0G8jiFLKANMcSv635feSWzFEZzw.jpg","https://assets.hospitable.com/property_images/904266/YHtogXTLlbxtZkabnIarbHLBq8k2tb8zZZjeL47I.jpg","https://assets.hospitable.com/property_images/904266/YovKE9gvrDSguKmArNWn6WlfQk8bRX0XI28R3Cnv.jpg","https://assets.hospitable.com/property_images/904266/mYok3ja7Dd0oZwSOl6mfpSHkcW0MDKFEE0gm9cR7.jpg","https://assets.hospitable.com/property_images/904266/HyzR5LCUii8HWYnUXSBsAee4C7pG3MaPc5zsvnG3.jpg","https://assets.hospitable.com/property_images/904266/OQRWeVQLKLPehpPB8u8XIjlwB2e1QwuXNSfZsP2s.jpg","https://assets.hospitable.com/property_images/904266/C2ySL6UOSYf0zEJZfKIED0gQmLXQ0I3U8vH3GJ7s.jpg","https://assets.hospitable.com/property_images/904266/POfnVZIzxg3QAg5u9rCUtHsWaC0Ij9d9GgY3YF8p.jpg","https://assets.hospitable.com/property_images/904266/wOS8ufu7XV7avojadyRtiT1h3LuYJzDuEt9aT1TL.jpg","https://assets.hospitable.com/property_images/904266/WvoJ4UnXvneyMVkXhPXnobmBIxeBnKDOHVEhR1Ft.jpg","https://assets.hospitable.com/property_images/904266/Qi6mskh6m7imzxHPj60m5pmVO5HaBYn3X1qP9iBI.jpg","https://assets.hospitable.com/property_images/904266/2uMp21UiGMntRR1MbxoZRsATXOPz5kKqMgmPZnJH.jpg","https://assets.hospitable.com/property_images/904266/K9NK5GHSg8x8byomh6HoMf5uWTsPWM529s0TuSRy.jpg","https://assets.hospitable.com/property_images/904266/uASgxqiv8yN2dHs9GJFYKL8JCMnKkQwhYDjoVDCj.jpg","https://assets.hospitable.com/property_images/904266/PxEKbCyY8TDr7PQl1TzIJthZctXGCjzNW1JOVuhT.jpg","https://assets.hospitable.com/property_images/904266/5Ze8LOy1P9A9d4kNDrJq2Gmi3UI5mqtepMoPyoC6.jpg","https://assets.hospitable.com/property_images/904266/AxsT4ZEvS64udLj8NrXqMBwo8GBzLQjpaOPH20dO.jpg","https://assets.hospitable.com/property_images/904266/l5B68dnyi09zNKQzEImRxvhKf9lhEItfBsmHzNIK.jpg","https://assets.hospitable.com/property_images/904266/7PdBLZMQ78EAWmRKLWNV96oAxdERI3Ix9lEZ8yxy.jpg","https://assets.hospitable.com/property_images/904266/tWjfmLXICpepJ0HMIvcDJNNzT9NvNPz2OQp1usgM.jpg","https://assets.hospitable.com/property_images/904266/7BeiDuTIovg6qPYL6gdvIrb4ERvwq3YzfgJEBtJa.jpg","https://assets.hospitable.com/property_images/904266/BUMTlhkcU0WaQvrLualeF7l1272NLXkrB1KprZPL.jpg","https://assets.hospitable.com/property_images/904266/zO3b3Eb2wHQLSjY3XyjR3vUeaB4QuCQE1JCYQIoc.jpg","https://assets.hospitable.com/property_images/904266/EcvwBbiqe7eNYe8AG35szdfGD40CmubbH1cvHTRV.jpg","https://assets.hospitable.com/property_images/904266/vFzw7yR7qofSLFIzGL2mR2bO144OfZkVCUlh5xdi.jpg","https://assets.hospitable.com/property_images/904266/zfoE4NWKaXnS6UhwhtMZQkwlWmD07M1lbNjBjJWS.jpg","https://assets.hospitable.com/property_images/904266/MBX8bJVGrqmmutnIAZSAQWGai08rttynMjRHPBGo.jpg","https://assets.hospitable.com/property_images/904266/jcLJOUCtZZNiYryZi4wNSkSQMNdzhM02vbJ9Ir6Q.jpg","https://assets.hospitable.com/property_images/904266/65hEEYM5EthWKsAlSzxWSPkYyhfvj3214qykrz82.jpg","https://assets.hospitable.com/property_images/904266/TqqS1QWb0QchdN4hRUlMJkEpZLVRo0H3JlzobOBA.jpg","https://assets.hospitable.com/property_images/904266/r3v0yz5r6hFXT6cOYMmLFFypYVlot7TXuzsEp3Jn.jpg",{"cfa6a066-72e8-4a24-a1e4-e48273983344":6},1754006295591]</script>
