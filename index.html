You'll take the back stairs up to the top where you'll meet your private patio & entrance to your apartment.  You'll be provided a code which activates at check-in time and deactivates just after check out.","There is plenty of off-street parking in the side lot - able to accommodate a moving van and more than one car if you have it. This is a 2nd floor apartment, accessed by exterior stairwell on the side of the home.  \n\nPETS:\nCats & Dogs that don't bark are welcome. I must be respectful of the neighbors so cannot have barkers.  Camp Bow-wow is a few blocks away if you have a dog that barks a lot.  There is a one-time pet fee.  Please include your pet on your reservation.",1752029053572]</script>
