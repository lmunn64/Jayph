Itâ€™s very close to downtown. The only issue I had was that the bedroom floor squeaky a lot. But overall, everything was great. I would definitely choose it again.",

There were great amenities, some I didnt utilize due to the short stay, but it had a full kitchen and laundry. The layout was very relaxing. The bed was comfortable and had clean hotel quality linens. Clean and comfortable furniture. Lots of room to spread out and feel at home.  The shower had good water and pressure. I will definitely stay here again when im in the area!",

This place had so much to do to keep not only the kids entertained, but the adults as well! The host was always quick to respond as well which is greatly appreciative. The place had everything we needed and more.",
