        <p>After years of traveling the world and living in different places, life eventually brought me to Kansas City—where I’ve lived for the past 15 years and where I met my husband, Phil. Travel has shaped my life in ways a desk never could. Serving in the Peace Corps in Nicaragua showed me how much more alike we are than different. Later, while living aboard 26 Carnival Cruise Line ships and creating children’s educational programs, I experienced countless cultures both at sea and in ports around the globe. Everywhere I’ve been, I’ve found the same familiar personalities we see at home—funny, sarcastic, playful, serious—just expressed a little differently in each culture.</p>

        <p>My hosting journey began about 10 years ago when I finished renovating my own midcentury-inspired apartment on the top floor. When I moved out, I listed it on Airbnb as my very first short-term rental. I then moved into the apartment below and gave it a completely different style. The green couch became my inspiration piece—I couldn’t pass it up—and soon the whole design flowed from there. That apartment became my second STR. From there, I flipped a few houses, fell in love with creating eclectic spaces that people truly want to be in, and eventually launched Fountain City Stays, where I now manage homes and apartments in Kansas City and Branson, MO.</p>

        <p>I’m passionate about great design, good food, and making life fun. When you book with me, I’ll happily share my favorite local spots. And even if you choose to stay somewhere else, I’d still love to pass along my recommendations so you can enjoy the best of what Kansas City and Branson have to offer!</p>

        <p>Have a great time visiting!</p>

        <p>~ Jaymi</p>
