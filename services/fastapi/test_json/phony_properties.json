      "description": "Large space - Fantastic location! Walking distance to many KC amenities:\n* 4 blocks to Nelson-Atkins, Kemper & Art Institute (& the beautiful campus)\n* 10 min walk to Westport\n* 3 min drive to the Plaza\n* 10 min drive to Downtown, Sprint Center & Convention Center\n* 2 blocks from Starbucks\n* 3 blocks from The Roasterie & Quick Trip Gas station\n\nNo LOCALS without GREAT reviews allowed.\n\nThis Relaxing Moroccan Boho Apartment was inspired by my trip to Morocco a few years back.  Love the bright colors & intricate patterns used & attempted to recreate here.  This first floor apartment is well laid out with a great open space to mingle between the Living & Dining Rooms.  A full service kitchen with newer appliances are available as well as laundry.  Feel free to relax in the rocker on the front porch - sip an evening cocktail with friends before heading out for a night in KC!  You have access to a back porch as well.\n\nOne of my favorite things about Kansas City are its old glorious buildings - which is why I fell in love with this 1900 Victorian charmer.  This home has seen a lot in it's 100+ years, including being converted into 4 separate apartments\n\nCoffee (& sugar & creamer) is provided, or take a short walk to Starbucks just 2 blocks away - or our local favorite, the Roasterie.  Log in to your personal TV apps on the Roku TV.  G. Fiber is the fastest internet in town.\n\nFor ideas on restaurants, night life & KC attractions while you're in town, check out my GUIDEBOOK online - a printed copy is also available in the home.\n\nLooking forward to seeing you soon!\nJaymi\n\nKeyless entry using a code for the lock on the front door.  Will be provided a day or two before your arrival.\n\nI am a pretty hands off host, knowing you've come to KC to visit with other folks & not me :)  Always available for questions & area suggestions!\n\nSouthmoreland is such a great neighborhood.  So close to so many things - the Art Institute, the Plaza, Westport, Downtown, a Starbucks 2 blocks away, the Nelson Atkins Museum.  It's even worth walking the neighborhood to see all the beautiful old homes!\n\nWestport also has some shops, restaurants & antique stores.\n\nUber is super easy and can wisk you home after a night on the town. Buses run regularly down Main St which is 2 blocks away.  They can get you anywhere!  Also soon to be a stop on the new streetcar line connecting Downtown to the Plaza!  It's currently running from Downtown to the River Market - a great (& free!) way to explore some of Kansas City.  Park/Uber to Union Station - and hop on the streetcar there! (free wifi)\n\nUber is approx $30 and 30min from the airport.\n\nThere is plenty of off-street parking in the side lot - able to accommodate a moving van and more than one car if you have it. Looking forward to your stay!  Welcome & enjoy.\n\nPETS:\nCats & Dogs that don't bark are welcome. I must be respectful of the neighbors so cannot have barkers. There is a one-time pet fee of $25.",

This home has seen a lot in it's 100+ years, including being converted into 4 separate apartments.  Your Cozy Midcentury 2 bedroom is on the 3rd floor.  Once you enter the space, you get to smile and settle in - you're in your home away from home.  Welcome & relax.\n\nI've scoured every antique store in the state to create an authentic mid-century space - focused on peace & comfort.  Enjoy high end bedding & towels.  You'll find a fully equipped kitchen to meet your cooking & entertaining needs.  Coffee (& sugar & creamer) is provided, or take a short walk to Starbucks just 2 blocks away, or our local favorite - the Roasterie.  Cable is provided, including access to 100's of channels & movies (just leave cash if you download a movie to rent).  There are also DVDs & board games under the tv for your entertainment.  G. Fiber Internet available - the fastest in town. \n\nIf you're here for work - there's a desk in the second bedroom for your use - right under the skylight so you can brainstorm with the clouds :)\n\nFor ideas on restaurants, night life & KC attractions while you're in town, check out my GUIDEBOOK online - a printed copy is also available in the home.\n\nYou access this space through the side door.  When facing the home, follow the sidewalk around to the left.  You will see the red door on the North side of the building.  Unit 3 is located at the TOP of the stairwell.\n\nI am a pretty hands off host, knowing you've come to KC to visit with other folks & not me :)  Always available for questions & area suggestions!\n\nSouthmoreland is such a great neighborhood.  So close to so many things - the Art Institute, the Plaza, Westport, Downtown, a Starbucks 2 blocks away, the Nelson Atkins Museum.  It's even worth walking the neighborhood to see all the beautiful old homes!\nWestport also has some shops, restaurants & antique stores.\n\nUber is super easy and can wisk you home after a night on the town. Buses run regularly down Main St which is 2 blocks away.  They can get you anywhere!  Also soon to be a stop on the new streetcar line connecting Downtown to the Plaza!  It's currently running from Downtown to the River Market - a great (& free!) way to explore some of Kansas City.  Park/Uber to Union Station - and hop on the streetcar there! (free wifi)\n\nUber is approx $30 and 30min from the airport.\n\nThere is plenty of off-street parking in the side lot - able to accommodate a moving van and more than one car if you have it. \n\nACCESS:\nThis is a 3rd floor apartment, accessed through the old & narrow butlers stairwell.  \n\nPETS:\nCats & Dogs that don't bark are welcome. We must be respectful of the neighbors so cannot have barkers. There is a one-time pet fee of $50.  You must clear your pets with me beforehand.\n\nPARTIES/GATHERINGS/GUESTS:\nKansas City takes gatherings VERY SERIOUSLY.  All guests must be pre-approved by host.  All guests must leave before 10pm.\n\nGUEST VERIFICATION:\nYou may be asked for additional verification",

You'll share a stairwell with one other apartment.  The outside door is to remained locked.\nYou access this space through the side door.  When facing the home, follow the sidewalk around to the left.  You will see the red door on the North side of the building.  Unit 2 is the Green Door on the second floor.\n\nFeel free to message me through the app.  I also live in the building so am often available if needed.\n\nSouthmoreland is a historic neighborhood lined with old Victorian homes much like this one. The apartment is just four blocks away from art museums like Nelson-Atkins, Kemper, and the Art Institute, a 5 minute drive to the Plaza & Westport and a 10 minute drive to downtown Kansas City.\n\nUber is super easy and can wisk you home after a night on the town. Buses run regularly down Main St which is 2 blocks away.  They can get you anywhere!  Also soon to be a stop on the new streetcar line connecting Downtown to the Plaza!  It's currently running from Downtown to the River Market - a great (& free!) way to explore some of Kansas City.  Park/Uber to Union Station - and hop on the streetcar there! (free wifi)\n\nUber is approx $45 and 30min from the airport.\n\nThere is plenty of off-street parking in the side lot - able to accommodate a moving van and more than one car if you have it. This is a 2nd floor apartment, accessed through the old butlers stairwell on the side of the home.  \n\nPETS:\nCats & Dogs that don't bark are welcome. I must be respectful of the neighbors so cannot have barkers. Camp Bow-wow is a few blocks away if you have a dog that barks a lot.  There is a one-time pet fee.  Please include your pet on your reservation.",

      "description": "Enjoy a stylish experience at this centrally-located 1 bedroom apartment in the heart of midtown KC!  Plenty of off-street parking!\n\nHistoric Southmoreland neighborhood is ideally located walking distance to restaurants, grocery & shopping. For ideas on restaurants, night life & KC attractions while you're in town, I'll send you a map of my favorites!\n\nNOTE:\n2nd floor apartment accessible only by stairs. No LOCALS without GREAT reviews allowed.\n\nOne of my favorite things about Kansas City are its old glorious buildings - which is why I fell in love with this 1900 Victorian charmer.  This home has seen a lot in it's 100+ years, including being converted into 4 separate apartments. \n\nThis Midtown getaway is a happy, refreshing and beautiful escape from the ordinary hotel.  Tall ceilings, fun touches and a clean palette create an inviting & refreshing space.  \n\nThis 1 bedroom apartment is on the 2nd floor - accessible only by an exterior stairwell.  You'll find a fully equipped kitchen to meet your cooking & entertaining needs.  Coffee, sugar & creamer are provided (or Starbucks is just 2 blocks away).  Access your own TV apps through the Roku Smart TV.   Fiber Internet available - the fastest in town. \n\nIf you're here for work - there's a desk in the living room & a printer for your use.\n\nYour apartment is in the rear of the building.  You'll take the back stairs up to the top where you'll meet your private patio & entrance to your apartment.  You'll be provided a code which activates at check-in time and deactivates just after check out.\n\nFeel free to message me through the app.  I also live in the building so am often available if needed.\n\nThere is plenty of off-street parking in the side lot - able to accommodate a moving van and more than one car if you have it. This is a 2nd floor apartment, accessed by exterior stairwell on the side of the home.  \n\nPETS:\nCats & Dogs that don't bark are welcome. I must be respectful of the neighbors so cannot have barkers.  Camp Bow-wow is a few blocks away if you have a dog that barks a lot.  There is a one-time pet fee.  Please include your pet on your reservation.",
