The beds were incredibly comfy (we all slept like rocks!), but hands down, the highlight was the bathroom. That clawfoot tub? My wife may or may not have taken an unnecessary number of baths.\n\nOur host went above and beyond with recommendations. It truly felt like staying at a friendâ€™s place (a very tasteful, very well-located friend).\n\nWould 100% stay again â€” and next time, Iâ€™m calling dibs on the bathtub first!",

The window air conditioners were key! \nThe brita water filter inside the fridge seemed to be expired. \nEverything else was wonderful! We all slept well! My wife now wants a claw foot bathtub. Thanks for sharing your home!",

Every detail, from the color palette to the carefully selected furnishings, was clearly chosen with intention. The space felt like a boutique hotelâ€”modern, elegant, and incredibly cozy.\n\nThe decor struck the perfect balance between stylish and comfortable. Soft lighting, tasteful art pieces, and high-quality linens made the stay feel luxurious. The kitchen was not only functional but beautifully styled, and even small touches like artisanal soaps added to the charm.\n\nJaymi was responsive and friendly, offering local tips that made our visit to KC even better.\n\nThe checkout process was the best Iâ€™ve ever seen. :)\n\nHighly recommend for anyone looking for a visually inspiring getaway. \n\nWeâ€™ll definitely be back!",
        "response": "Thank you so much, Elizabeth, for sharing your experience and recommending our house! Iâ€™m so glad you all enjoyed the design touches and found the checkout seamless. Thank you as well for being fabulous guests!  Looking forward to welcoming you back on your next KC adventure!!\nJaymi"

The house only has one shower, but the full bathroom is large, well vented, and had lots of natural light which was a plus! There is a half bathroom on the first floor which was convenient for us to use when we were all downstairs. We would definitely stay here again in the future!",
