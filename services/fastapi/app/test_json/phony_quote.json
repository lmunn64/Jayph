Whitewashed walls highlight high, beamed ceilings, while the decor fuses antique and modern pieces with eclectic art.  This Midtown getaway is a refreshing and beautiful escape from the ordinary hotel.  \n\nFor ideas on restaurants, night life & KC attractions while you're in town, I'll send you a map of my favorites!\n\nNo LOCALS without GREAT reviews allowed.\n\nOne of my favorite things about Kansas City are its old buildings & glorious architecture - which is why I fell in love with this 1900 Victorian charmer.  This home has seen a lot in it's 100+ years, including being converted into 4 separate apartments. \n\nThis Midtown getaway is a happy, refreshing and beautiful escape from the ordinary hotel.  Tall ceilings, fun touches and a clean palette create an inviting & refreshing space.  \n\nYour Shabby Chic 2 bedroom is on the 2nd floor - accessible only by stairs.  You'll find a fully equipped kitchen for all of your cooking & entertaining needs.  Coffee, sugar & creamer are provided (or several local coffee shops are close by!).  Access your own TV apps through the Roku Smart TV.   Fiber Internet available - the fastest in town. \n\nIf you're here for work - there's a desk in the second bedroom for your use.\n\nYou'll be provided a smartlock code.  You'll share a stairwell with one other apartment.  The outside door is to remained locked.\nYou access this space through the side door.  When facing the home, follow the sidewalk around to the left.  You will see the red door on the North side of the building.  Unit 2 is the Green Door on the second floor.\n\nFeel free to message me through the app.  I also live in the building so am often available if needed.\n\nSouthmoreland is a historic neighborhood lined with old Victorian homes much like this one. The apartment is just four blocks away from art museums like Nelson-Atkins, Kemper, and the Art Institute, a 5 minute drive to the Plaza & Westport and a 10 minute drive to downtown Kansas City.\n\nUber is super easy and can wisk you home after a night on the town. Buses run regularly down Main St which is 2 blocks away.  They can get you anywhere!  Also soon to be a stop on the new streetcar line connecting Downtown to the Plaza!  It's currently running from Downtown to the River Market - a great (& free!) way to explore some of Kansas City.  Park/Uber to Union Station - and hop on the streetcar there! (free wifi)\n\nUber is approx $45 and 30min from the airport.\n\nThere is plenty of off-street parking in the side lot - able to accommodate a moving van and more than one car if you have it. This is a 2nd floor apartment, accessed through the old butlers stairwell on the side of the home.  \n\nPETS:\nCats & Dogs that don't bark are welcome. I must be respectful of the neighbors so cannot have barkers. Camp Bow-wow is a few blocks away if you have a dog that barks a lot.  There is a one-time pet fee.  Please include your pet on your reservation.",

        "description": "Enjoy a stylish experience at this centrally-located 1 bedroom apartment in the heart of midtown KC!  Plenty of off-street parking!\n\nHistoric Southmoreland neighborhood is ideally located walking distance to restaurants, grocery & shopping. For ideas on restaurants, night life & KC attractions while you're in town, I'll send you a map of my favorites!\n\nNOTE:\n2nd floor apartment accessible only by stairs. No LOCALS without GREAT reviews allowed.\n\nOne of my favorite things about Kansas City are its old glorious buildings - which is why I fell in love with this 1900 Victorian charmer.  This home has seen a lot in it's 100+ years, including being converted into 4 separate apartments. \n\nThis Midtown getaway is a happy, refreshing and beautiful escape from the ordinary hotel.  Tall ceilings, fun touches and a clean palette create an inviting & refreshing space.  \n\nThis 1 bedroom apartment is on the 2nd floor - accessible only by an exterior stairwell.  You'll find a fully equipped kitchen to meet your cooking & entertaining needs.  Coffee, sugar & creamer are provided (or Starbucks is just 2 blocks away).  Access your own TV apps through the Roku Smart TV.   Fiber Internet available - the fastest in town. \n\nIf you're here for work - there's a desk in the living room & a printer for your use.\n\nYour apartment is in the rear of the building.  You'll take the back stairs up to the top where you'll meet your private patio & entrance to your apartment.  You'll be provided a code which activates at check-in time and deactivates just after check out.\n\nFeel free to message me through the app.  I also live in the building so am often available if needed.\n\nThere is plenty of off-street parking in the side lot - able to accommodate a moving van and more than one car if you have it. This is a 2nd floor apartment, accessed by exterior stairwell on the side of the home.  \n\nPETS:\nCats & Dogs that don't bark are welcome. I must be respectful of the neighbors so cannot have barkers.  Camp Bow-wow is a few blocks away if you have a dog that barks a lot.  There is a one-time pet fee.  Please include your pet on your reservation.",
