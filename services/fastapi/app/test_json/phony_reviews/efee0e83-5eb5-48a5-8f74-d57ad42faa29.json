It appears that there were logins left on the main TV, which prevented us from accessing Netflix. We found ourselves stuck on a credit card payment page and couldn’t navigate past it, so we ended up watching shows on our laptop instead.\n\nI thought it might be helpful to let you know, as clearing previous logins could enhance the experience for future guests.\n\nThank you again for your hospitality!\n\nBest regards,  \nHeather Baker",

The room looked like the pictures. Being on the middle floor you could hear the upstairs neighbors, but it didn’t bother us too much. I did notice some wear and tear on the door to the bedroom, and a green chair in the bedroom. But overall the furniture was in good condition and my husband said he slept well on the bed. I do feel like the bathroom could have been cleaned better. Upon our arrival I notice hair in the shower, smudges on the mirror, and the tub/sink faucets and tub jets were not cleaned well there were some water stains and rusts. Overall for the price we would stay here again! Being so close to SDC was a perk. Jaymi was also a great hosts! I enjoyed her detailed messages about the resort and Branson in general.",
