There were great amenities, some I didnt utilize due to the short stay, but it had a full kitchen and laundry. The layout was very relaxing. The bed was comfortable and had clean hotel quality linens. Clean and comfortable furniture. Lots of room to spread out and feel at home.  The shower had good water and pressure.
