        "review": "Jaymi is an AMAZING host, and that is definitely reflected in all the touches she has put in to this place.  The apartment is spacious and cozy all at once.  Both beds were uber comfy, everything i needed to cook during a ~3 week stay was provided in the kitchen (pots, pans, baking dishes, silverware, great knives, grater, corkscrew, can opener, wooden spoons, great glassware and dishes, right down to an amazing cocktail shaker!).  The retro decor is again simultaneously bright AND warm.  THe couch was super welcoming for the cold days I was there. There were space heaters and lap blankets in the closets for the coldest of days, extra bedding.  For my stay, I especially appreciated the washer and dryer and I even found liquid detergent in the bathroom.  I positively adored the LOCATION  with all that’s best (imho) about Kansas City so nearby; I had a great time exploring old haunts as well as new places, with some great recommendations from Jaymi on her list.  I can’t think of anything i would change and i would certainly stay here again whenever I’m back in KC.  Don’t miss this great space, and don’t miss out on Jaymi as host extraordinaire!",

Clearly, it didn’t bother me a lot, but i wanted to signal to you in case it may indicate an issue to be addressed before it’s too late.  Again, I LOVED LOVED LOVED my stay at your place.  :)",

I enjoyed morning walks to the Nelson Atkins Museum of Art Sculpture Garden and the historic Country Club Plaza filled with fountains and great boutiques. Jaymi has incredible design savvy, and the home is artfully decorated in welcoming colors. The modern kitchen had all the amenities we needed. Best of all, I appreciate that Jaymi is pet friendly. We brought our two cats with us, and they loved being on the top floor overlooking the school playground across the street. Our kitties will miss seeing the children chase soccer balls and cheerful sounds. BONUS: On-site parking. We parked two cars in the parking lot and didn’t have the hassle of street parking.",
