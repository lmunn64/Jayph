        "review": "Overall, Jaymi did a great job as our host.  She provided information about the house and popular Branson attractions well in advance of our arrival.  Jaymi provided quick and thorough responses to all messages and texts sent before, during and after our stay.  When we arrived and let her know the house was still being cleaned, she jumped on it and had additional cleaners and two supervisors join the cleaners already on-site to get the house cleaned as quickly as possible (was ready for check-in around 5:30pm).  Because we could not check-in at 4pm, Jaymi agreed to not charge us for the cleaning fee and allowed a later check-out time on Sunday, 21 July.  The cleaning fee was credited to our credit card account a few days after we checked-out.  Recommend Jaymi provide her cell number to one of the informational messages sent prior to check-in. There were multiple issues with the house which we will provide to Jaymi in hopes they will be addressed as quickly as possible.",

All but the last two items, should have been addressed prior to our arrival:\n\n- The downstairs game room TV did not work.\n- The upstairs bathroom floors had clumps of dirt or something on them (can provide photo).\n- The upstairs wood floor was dirty, did not appear to have been mopped (can provide photo).\n- The icemaker in the kitchen frig was not working.\n- The house was not completely child-friendly/safe.  Outlets were not covered and the gate to the downstairs had a significant gap between the bottom of the gate and the first step.\n- The foosball table had a broken leg and a kid's toothbrush was found in one of the goals (can provide photo).\n- The tabletop shuffleboard table was broke at one end such that the pucks would fly off the table (can provide photo).\n- All the mattresses should be replaced...too soft.",

All trash was taken out and I started the dishwasher. I had no clue there are fees for dishes. Everywhere else weâ€™ve ever stayed have a cleaning crew and that comes with the stay. So everyone wash ALL dishes and if someone vomits and youâ€™re not aware itâ€™s an extra $260â€¦you pay for the cleaning crew and dishes in the sink. Master bedroom is super cold and the 4th room with queen bed downstairs has no air circulating and no windows.",

The location was perfect for our priority of the trip which was seeing the holiday lights at SDC.  Leaving the park late on Saturday we were still able to get back to the condo in less than 5 minutes, and after a long day, not having to deal with traffic going back into town is worth its weight in gold.  The amenities were great and my 13 year old niece had an amazing time getting to decorate the Christmas tree that had just been put up.  From my 91 year old grandmother to my 13 year old niece and all in between we had a wonderful stay and would not hesitate to stay again.  Maybe this time during golf season though:)",
