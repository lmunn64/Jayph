        "review": "The location was very convenient as I was commuting back and fourth from St. Luke’s Hospital. The space was as advertised and I had a quiet, spacious place to come home to everyday. Jaymi was a very responsive host and communicated well. In my opinion, the biggest drawback of the apartment is a lack of comfortable seating, specifically with regards to the dining room. When I book places for “long-term” stays, I do expect there to be ample supplies of household items (toilet paper, paper towel, garbage bags, cleaner, etc.) so that I do not have to purchase them myself which unfortunately happened during my stay. It is for these reasons that I rated the value 3/5 stars. The linens, towels, and cloths were clean but I felt like the apartment had not been throughly cleaned for some time.\n\nIn summary I enjoyed my month-long stay at Jaymi’s place but I believe it to be on the expensive side based on a lack of comfort and inadequate supplies for longer stays.",

This place is Huge, a large living room and dining room. The home has tons of natural lighting. Our favorite spot was the spacious front porch. Perfect place to drink coffee in the morning, take an afternoon nap on the couch and gather in the evening for pizza and deep conversations. Honestly I was just looking for somewhere affordable to stay while we explored the city but in the end, relaxing at this Airbnb was the favorite part of our trip.",

Check in was a breeze, parking is great. \n\nA few recommendations: I saw in your instructions to start a load of laundry, but then the water was turned off on the washer, so I was a little confused if I should start the laundry or not. With there being other tenants there I was unsure what grill to use. There are few maintenance items; trashcan lid is broken, some floor vents are not attached, and the bathroom door doesn't open all the way and the trim around the door is loose. I would also recommend a mattress topper on the beds. I would also add a highlight that the place is also walking distance to a family park. I also could have asked you, but I had issues with ROKU tv, couldn't figure out how access my Disney+ or HBO, couldn't find those apps on the TV. \n\nThis is my first time using airbnb, so not sure if people go into detail in here or should just say \"thanks\". Regardless of those recommendations, I really enjoyed my stay and would look to stay with you again. Just had a fun time with family. Thank you also for stopping in a saying hello, and listening to my 2 yr old chat, you could probably tell she was really liking her stay, she is usually shy around new people. Thank you again.",

        "review": "Jaymi’s place is absolutely stylish and unique. It is just like the photos and even more amazing in person. The king size bed is very comfortable. I am on a night shift schedule and found it very easy to sleep during the day here and the full size bed bedroom is easy to make dim during the day. Now there is a unit above this one so occasionally you’ll hear steps and even voices but I never thought it got too loud. I felt very safe here. Jaymi was awesome and replied within a normal time. She also gave me lots of recommendations. The kitchen has everything you could need and there is a washer and dryer in the unit. She has hangers in the closet and extra sheets if you need him. Noche is the name of the outdoor cat and he made me feel at home and is nice to pet. I loved this place and recommend it to anyone. You’re only 15 minute walk from Westport and Nelson Atkins museum. Very close to parks and a great place to run",
