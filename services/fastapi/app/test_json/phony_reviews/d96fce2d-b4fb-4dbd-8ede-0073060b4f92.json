Everything was super clean,  the house was stocked well, and the host was responsive to all needs. The house is huge, and allowed our family to spread out and enjoy some down time. Now for the best part….the entertainment!  The game room was amazing!! It provided hours and hours of fun for our family!  The popcorn machine was a hit!  The vibe was so relaxed, the room was decorated in a 90’s theme with an Atari. The pool table downstairs was the best. We enjoyed pool tournaments every night for the entire week we stayed. The downstairs had plenty of seating for a large crowd to hang out while competing. There was a balcony on the top floor where we enjoyed a few meals enclosed in a patio and there was an outdoor patio where I enjoyed reading my book with a fabulous view. We come for basketball nationals every year from Texas and we will definitely rent this house again! Thanks!",
