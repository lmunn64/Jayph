I really appreciated a well-equipped kitchen (even a full size Ninja blender!)\nThe apartment felt peaceful and cheerful. \nJaymi went the extra mile for us — we were in a pinch coming from another airbnb where the A/C broke (outdoor temps in the 90s) and Jaymi worked extra hard to let us check-in early — much appreciated! especially since guests had vacated that morning.\nShe also has a gorgeous 2-bedroom apartment upstairs in the same building.\nWe look forward to returning.",
