I really appreciated a well-equipped kitchen (even a full size Ninja blender!)\nThe apartment felt peaceful and cheerful. \nJaymi went the extra mile for us — we were in a pinch coming from another airbnb where the A/C broke (outdoor temps in the 90s) and Jaymi worked extra hard to let us check-in early — much appreciated! especially since guests had vacated that morning.\nShe also has a gorgeous 2-bedroom apartment upstairs in the same building.\nWe look forward to returning.",

Jaymi is incredibly responsive and detailed in her communication.\n\nIn retrospect, we’d read the description and looked at pictures—all accurate and beautiful—but we didn’t read the reviews. Jaymi’s description was accurate and well deserving of her star rating, but the reviews tell more about the load HVAC and thinness of the walls in this 120+ year old home. We could hear the neighbor’s binging on movies (heard the MGM lion’s roar a few times) and Parks & Rec (as we hummed to the very familiar theme song a few times) and upstairs neighbors conversations. So when she warns of quiet hours and old home, she means it. It made us a little on edge as you don’t want to be the one disturbing everyone else. \n\nI also loved Jaymi’s thorough recommendations, some I’d been to before and enjoyed. All in all, we enjoyed our stay, the kitchen, cleanliness, and everything Jaymi provided!",

Die Lüftung hat ebenfalls seinen Teil dazu beigetragen und war sehr laut.\nWeiterhin konnten wir sowohl im Bad, als auch auf Decken im Schlafzimmer Haare feststellen, was zu unserem Unmut geführt hat.",
