Having the game room was super fun.\n\nThe maintenance people fixed the master bed at 11 Bogey promptly. The slats were not screwed in under the head of the bed and it collapsed under the guests. But they fixed it enough for the first night, and all was well.\n\nThe kitchen sink faucet was very wiggly and we had to screw it in twice. A more permanent fix might be good. But again it was no big deal for us -- we weren't fazed.",

For one, Jaymi was very proactive and patient as we asked all kinds of questions and she was very accommodating to our group. Most importantly, the layout of the bedrooms and other rooms really worked well for us. We had a mix of people, ranging from 3 months to 80 years old and everyone had plenty of \"personal\" space in addition to the open areas where we all gathered. And the kitchen was wonderful for us to do our cooking. The back patios were really nice too and very comfortable to sit on despite the heat.\n\nWe have been to quite a few places over the years and Jaymi's was absolutely the best. In fact, the whole group is talking about going back next year too! Would give 10-stars if I could.\n\nYou will not be disappointed at all and you will appreciate all that Jaymi does while you're staying at her wonderful home.",
